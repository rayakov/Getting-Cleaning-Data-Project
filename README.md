Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.

The included R script, run_analysis.R, conducts the following:

1 - Download the dataset from web if it does not already exist in the working directory.
2 - Read both the train and test datasets and merge them into x(measurements), y(activity) and subject, respectively.
3 - Load the data(x's) feature, activity info and extract columns named 'mean'(-mean) and 'standard'(-std). Also, modify column names to descriptive. (-mean to Mean, -std to Std, and remove symbols like -, (, ))
4 - Extract data by selected columns(from step 3), and merge x, y(activity) and subject data. Also, replace y(activity) column to it's name by refering activity label (loaded step 3).
5 - Generate 'Tidy Dataset' that consists of the average (mean) of each variable for each subject and each activity. The result is shown in the file tidy_dataset.txt.
